First, let's listen to the audio content. On the left, Xiao Ming inquires about recruitment information for promoters, and on the right, Xiao Wang responds that they are recruiting promoters, mainly for APP promotion, with a basic monthly salary of 3000 yuan plus commission. Xiao Ming also asked about working hours, location, and transportation methods, and Xiao Wang suggested using an electric bicycle or public transportation.

        <h2>参考 Reasoning (Reference Reasoning)</h2>
        <p>好的，我现在需要分析用户提供的音频内容及其特征，来判断通话场景属于哪一种类型。首先，用户给出的场景选项包括订餐服务、咨询客服、预约服务、交通咨询、日常购物、打车服务和外卖服务。\n\n音频内容主要是左声道（小明）和右声道（客服小王）的对话。小明在五八同城上听到招聘地推员的信息，想了解具体细节，包括职位性质（全职）、薪酬待遇、工作时间以及应聘所需材料。客服小王则逐一回答了这些问题，提供了详细的职位信息和流程。\n\n接下来，我需要分析这些内容属于哪个场景。首先，排除订餐服务、外卖服务，因为对话中没有涉及订餐或送餐相关内容。交通咨询和打车服务也不相关，因为没有提到交通路线、打车需求等。日常购物也不对，因为对话主题是招聘而不是购物。预约服务通常涉及预约时间、地点等，比如预约医生或服务，但这里讨论的是招聘职位，可能属于咨询客服的范畴。咨询客服一般是用户向客服询问产品或服务的信息，这里小明是在询问招聘信息，属于求职咨询，而客服小王作为公司客服提供职位详情，符合咨询客服的场景。\n\n音频特征方面，左声道语速快且紧张，可能显示求职者的急切心情；右声道语气中性，回答模糊，但根据文本，实际上客服的回答是具体的，比如薪酬结构、工作时间明确。可能特征描述中的“模糊”与实际文本有些出入，但关键点还是听内容。\n\n总结，对话的核心是求职者咨询招聘信息，客服提供详细信息，属于咨询客服。因此，场景应为“咨询客服”，理由充分，置信度较高，可能在0.9左右，因为内容完全符合客服咨询的特征。</p>
        <div class="translation">
            I need to analyze the audio content and its characteristics provided by the user to determine which type of call scenario it belongs to. First, the scenario options provided by the user include food ordering service, customer service consultation, appointment service, transportation inquiry, daily shopping, taxi service, and food delivery service.

            The audio content mainly consists of dialogue between the left channel (Xiao Ming) and right channel (Customer Service Xiao Wang). Xiao Ming heard about a promotional staff recruitment information on 58.com and wanted to learn about specific details, including the nature of the position (full-time), salary package, working hours, and required application materials. Customer Service Xiao Wang answered these questions one by one, providing detailed position information and processes.

            Next, I need to analyze which scenario this content belongs to. First, we can eliminate food ordering service and food delivery service, as the dialogue doesn't involve any food ordering or delivery content. Transportation inquiry and taxi service are also irrelevant, as there's no mention of traffic routes or taxi needs. Daily shopping is also incorrect, as the dialogue topic is recruitment rather than shopping. Appointment service usually involves scheduling time and location, such as booking a doctor or service, but here the discussion is about a job position, which might fall under customer service consultation. Customer service consultation typically involves users inquiring about product or service information from customer service representatives. Here, Xiao Ming is inquiring about recruitment information, which is job consultation, and Customer Service Xiao Wang provides position details as a company representative, fitting the customer service consultation scenario.

            Regarding audio characteristics, the left channel speaks quickly and nervously, possibly showing the job seeker's eagerness; the right channel's tone is neutral, with responses described as vague, but according to the text, the customer service's answers are actually specific, such as clear salary structure and working hours. The "vague" description in the characteristics might differ somewhat from the actual text, but the key point is still the content.

            In conclusion, the core of the dialogue is a job seeker consulting about recruitment information, with customer service providing detailed information, which belongs to customer service consultation. Therefore, the scenario should be "customer service consultation," with sufficient reasoning and high confidence, probably around 0.9, as the content completely matches the characteristics of customer service consultation.

            <div class="translation">
                I'll now evaluate the model's reasoning process and answers based on the user-provided scoring criteria. First, I need to carefully analyze the model's reasoning process and final answer, then compare them with the standard answer and reference reasoning process, check the probability of each scoring point, and finally calculate the expected score.

                First, determine if the model's conclusion is correct. The model concluded the scenario as "customer service consultation", which matches the standard answer, so the conclusion is correct and won't trigger the constraints for incorrect conclusions.
                
                Next, analyze the logical rigor section:
                
                1. Complete reasoning chain without gaps (1 point probability): The model's reasoning process first analyzed the audio content, eliminated other possible scenarios, and finally determined customer service consultation. The steps are relatively complete but may lack detailed explanation of the "customer service consultation" definition. The reference reasoning analyzed each eliminated scenario in more detail, while the model mentioned them but perhaps not thoroughly enough. Therefore, there's an 80% probability of getting 1 point.
                
                2. Reasonable and explicit key assumptions (1 point probability): The model assumes customer service consultation includes career counseling - is this reasonable? The standard answer also considers it customer service consultation, so the assumption is reasonable. But did the model explicitly state this? In the reasoning, the model mentions "customer service consultation might be closer" but may not explicitly reference typical customer service content. So probability might be 90%, as the assumption is reasonable but perhaps not explicit enough.
                
                3. Conclusion derivation rigor: Was the model rigorous in eliminating other options? For example, was appointment service correctly eliminated? The model mentions appointment services involve scheduling, which isn't present in the dialogue, so this elimination is logical. But were all possibilities thoroughly discussed? 70% probability of getting 2 points, 20% probability of 1 point.
                
                4. Advantages compared to reference reasoning: The reference reasoning analyzed each eliminated scenario in more detail, while the model's reasoning was more concise. Does the model have advantages in some aspects? Probably no significant advantages, so 10% probability.
                
                Practical value section:
                
                1. Problem essence identification accuracy: Correctly identified as customer service consultation, so 100% probability.
                
                2. Solution effectiveness: The solution is correct classification and effective. But was the model's analysis comprehensive? 80% probability of 2 points, 15% probability of 1 point.
                
                3. Need coverage completeness: Covered user needs, correct classification, so 90% probability.
                
                4. Optimization compared to reference: Likely no optimization, so 10% probability.
                
                Expression quality:
                
                1. Key node presentation completeness: Did the model present key steps? Such as eliminating other scenarios, determining customer service consultation. Relatively complete but might lack detailed discussion of audio features. Thus 80% probability.
                
                2. Expression clarity: Is the reasoning process clear? Steps are clear but some areas might lack detail. 60% probability of 2 points, 30% probability of 1 point.
                
                3. Information conciseness: Is it concise? Maybe too brief, e.g., didn't discuss each eliminated scenario in detail. 70% probability.
                
                4. Expression advantages compared to reference: Reference reasoning is more detailed, model might not be as good, so 20% probability.
                
                Now these considerations need to be converted into specific percentage values and expected scores calculated. Note that each scoring point needs to be carefully compared against scoring rules, considering whether there are logical jumps or missing evidence. For example, in logical rigor, does the model's reasoning have jumps? Like when eliminating appointment services, was it detailed enough? There might be slight jumps, causing probability decay. But overall, with correct conclusions, most scoring points can maintain relatively high probabilities.
